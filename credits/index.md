This site is built using [Netlify][1] and [11ty][2]. The basic blog framework is from the [11ty base blog][3].

The colour scheme came from [coolors.co][4], aren't they the prettiest! I've used [Skeleton CSS][5] as a boilerplate for the styling and grid stuff. Please excuse the styling. It's been years since I worked on front-end dev work.

I have also read so many tutorials. You have no idea. If I could link to them all, I would.
